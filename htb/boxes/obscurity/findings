In the initial webpage we found a name of a python script: SuperSecureServer.py
To get it we will start dirbusting in different depth.
1st normal dirbusting (can also be with wfuzz)

2nd dirbusting with url fuzz just set the same url with    /{dir}/SuperSecureServer.py
for wfuzz on terminal:

```
$ wfuzz -t 200 -u http://10.10.10.168:8080/FUZZ/SuperSecureServer.py -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  --hc 404
```

-t <number of threads>

in url we point with FUZZ the dir to dirbust

--hc 404    is used to hide the 404 codes ("not found" code)

in case we are searching for a specific code we add the arg:
--h <desired code>



now from this wfuzz execution we got "develop" payload
